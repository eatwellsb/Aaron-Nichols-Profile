        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a mission-driven education professional dedicated to building strong communities by
            empowering young people and supporting families. My background spans early learning support,
            language instruction, community-based program development, and district-level program management.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether coordinating partners across multiple school sites, designing culturally relevant learning
            experiences, or mentoring multilingual families, I approach leadership as service — grounded in 
            listening, partnership, and the belief that every child deserves a strong start.
